"""
Rosenbrock's valley is a classic optimization problem,
also known as Banana function. The global optimum is inside a
long, narrow, parabolic shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial,
however convergence to the global optimum is difficult and hence this
problem has been repeatedly used
in assess the performance of optimization algorithms.
